## MoneyMod - A basic AMXmodX plugin for adding a money system based off kills

**Commands:**
  /spawnshop - Spawns a shop NPC to buy things from. Shop menu not implemented.

**History:**

  This plugin hasn't been tested in years so I have no clue if it'll compile and work.
  I made this plugin back in highschool (~2007) as a successor to my previous Money/Shop plugin.
  Reason being, my previous plugin's source code was lost in a hard drive crash leaving me with only the compiled plugin.
  Over time, I lost interest in continuing it as most of my friends had stopped playing Half-Life and Half-Life mods.
